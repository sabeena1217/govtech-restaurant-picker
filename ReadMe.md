This is developed using
- Java 17
- SpringBoot 3
- Thymeleaf
- H2 database
- OpenAPI for documentation

Moreover, I have used spring-sessions to facilitate the session management

Also, I have introduced a database script, to load the initial users and restaurants to the database. You can do the same using the introduced REST API endpoints.

By default, the web application is hosted in http://localhost:8080/
